# SafetyObservationsCollector

This application can combine a SafetyMonitor and a ObservingConditions ASCOM driver into a single safe/unsafe decision

* Safe/Unsafe state from SafetyMonitor is taken 

* Every sensor item from the ObservingConditions driver can be taken into evalution.

* The output from both drivers will finally generate a safe/unsafe state.
